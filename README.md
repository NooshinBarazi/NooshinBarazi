ðŸ‘‹ Hey!
I'm a frontend developer who enjoys turning ideas into smooth, scalable, and user-friendly web experiences using React, Next.js, and other modern tools.

For me, frontend isn't just about code â€” itâ€™s where logic meets creativity. I love the challenge of building fast apps that also feel good to use.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into AI-powered interfaces, design systems, and micro frontends â€” and sharing what I learn along the way.
Always curious, always building. Letâ€™s see where this journey goes â€” one component at a time.
